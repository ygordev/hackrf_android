Known Issues
------------
* USB connection is too slow for Sample Rates >15 Msps (testet on Nexus 7)
* FileWriter in example app is too slow. Only works for ~ 2 Msps on old devices.
* It seems that the HackRF sometimes gets to less power if using a to long or low
  quality USB cable.


Installation / Usage
--------------------
Build the library and the example app by using the Android Studio projects:
* hackrf_android/
* hackrf_android/examples/

If you want to use the library in your own app, just copy the 
hackrf_android/app/build/outputs/aar/app-debug.aar file into your project and 
include it as a library. See the example project to learn how to use the library.

The hackrf_android.aar and the HackRF_Test.apk files are also in this repository
so that they can be used without building them. But they won't be synched to the
latest code base all the time.

A short howto to get started can be found on this blog post:
[http://tech.mantz-it.com/2014/10/hackrfandroid-using-hackrf-with-android.html]
(http://tech.mantz-it.com/2014/10/hackrfandroid-using-hackrf-with-android.html)

Use the example application to test the library on your device and trouble shoot
any problems. It has the option to show the logcat output!
